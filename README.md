# Monthly Air Pollution in the United States from 1990-2015
This repo is a result of data analysis completed as part of the 2016 Summer of Maps Program. This work was completed in support of a pro bono project with Chemical Heritage Foundation. 

Summer of Maps is a fellowship program organized and facilitated by Azavea. Azavea is a B Corporation that specializes in civic-minded GIS software development and spatial analysis.

Summer of Maps offers stipends to student spatial analysts to perform data analysis and visualization for non-profit organizations. Every year we match up non-profit organizations that have spatial analysis needs with talented students to implement projects over a three-month period during the summer.

The purpose of this work is to inform the public about air pollution in the United States from 1990-2015.
The intended use of this work is to be incorporated into the Chemical Heritage Foundation's history of science museum.
This work includes contributions from Annaka Scheeres, who was the lead developer and designer for this project, and Tyler Dahlberg, who was the mentor.
